# Accessibility Improvements

This document outlines the changes made to address Google Lighthouse accessibility feedback for the SAID (Student AI Disclosure) application.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Buttons Without Accessible Names

**Problem:** Buttons, especially icon-only buttons, lacked accessible names, making them unusable for screen reader users.

**Solution:**
- Updated the Button component to check for missing accessible names
- Added warnings in development mode for icon buttons without aria-labels
- Created the AccessibilityProvider component to automatically add aria-labels to icon buttons
- Implemented helper functions in accessibility-enhancements.ts for adding accessible names

### 2. Insufficient Color Contrast

**Problem:** Background and foreground colors did not have sufficient contrast ratios, making content difficult to read for users with low vision.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced color contrast ratios in globals.css:
  - Increased contrast for text and background colors
  - Used maximum contrast (black/white) for critical UI elements
  - Improved contrast for secondary and muted colors
  - Adjusted destructive colors for better visibility
- Created high-contrast color variables that meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 minimum contrast ratio)

### 3. Links Relying Only on Color

**Problem:** Links were only distinguishable by color, making them difficult to identify for users with color blindness or low vision.

**Solution:**
- Added underlines to all links by default in globals.css
- Enhanced focus states with thicker outlines (3px instead of 2px)
- Increased outline offset for better visibility
- Created utility functions in accessibility-enhancements.ts to ensure links are visually distinguishable

## Implementation Details

### New Files Created

1. **accessibility-enhancements.ts**
   - Contains utility functions for improving accessibility
   - Provides methods for adding accessible names to buttons
   - Includes high-contrast color definitions
   - Contains functions to make links visually distinguishable

2. **AccessibilityProvider.tsx**
   - Client-side component that initializes accessibility enhancements
   - Automatically finds and fixes icon buttons without accessible names
   - Wraps the application content to ensure enhancements are applied

### Modified Files

1. **button.tsx**
   - Enhanced to check for missing accessible names
   - Added development warnings for inaccessible buttons
   - Improved focus states for keyboard users
   - Made link variant more distinguishable with permanent underlines

2. **globals.css**
   - Improved color contrast ratios throughout the application
   - Added underlines to links by default
   - Enhanced focus states with thicker outlines
   - Added utility classes for accessibility

3. **layout.tsx**
   - Integrated AccessibilityProvider to initialize enhancements
   - Properly structured landmarks for screen readers
   - Ensured screen reader announcer is properly implemented

## Testing Recommendations

To verify these improvements:

1. Run Lighthouse accessibility tests again to confirm issues are resolved
2. Test with keyboard navigation to ensure all interactive elements are accessible
3. Use a screen reader to verify buttons have proper accessible names
4. Check color contrast with tools like the WebAIM Contrast Checker
5. Test with color blindness simulators to ensure links are distinguishable

## Future Improvements

1. Implement a high-contrast mode toggle for users who need additional contrast
2. Add more comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for navigation
3. Create automated accessibility tests to prevent regression
4. Conduct user testing with people who use assistive technologies
